# micromouse_maze

Creates a maze world and spawns a turtlebot3 at one of the corners of the maze (either at (7.5m, 7.5m) or (-7.5m, 7.5m) or (-7.5m, -7.5m) or (7.5m, -7.5m)) facing outwards.

The size of the maze is 16m x 16m.

The maze is centered in the world. So the very center of the maze correspondes to x=0 and y=0  coordinates.

To be able to finish the maze you should reach to the target square with center located at x=0 and y=0 coordinates and each side of 2m.

A sample view from the simulation world can be seen in the following Fig.

# Install

```
cd ~/robotlar_ws/src
git clone https://gitlab.com/blm6191_2023_1/blm6191/micromouse_maze.git
cd ~/robotlar_ws
catkin_make
source ~/.bashrc
```

Make sure that you have defined waffle as default robot type
```
echo "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Also make sure your workspace is defined within GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH variable
```
echo "export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}:~/robotlar_ws/src/" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Run
Run with maze 1:
```
roslaunch micromouse_maze micromouse_maze1.launch
```

Run with maze 2:
```
roslaunch micromouse_maze micromouse_maze2.launch
```

# Check for the Following

After you run the launch files check for the tf tree with the following command in a new terminal window.

```
rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```
You should see a tf tree similar to following Fig. 

![TF Tree](img/frames.png "TF Tree")

Roslaunch also starts Rviz window with a predefined config. Check for the following: 

- fixed frame is set to odom

![Fixed Frame](img/fixed_frame.png "Fixed Frame")

- LaserScan message and TF message are added to Rviz

- odom and base_link TF's are visible and /scan message is visualized

Lastly check for the topic list command and its result as follows in a new terminal window

```
$ rostopic list

# What is missing

- Create a new roscpp package namely solve_maze with required dependencies. 

- Create a new node source namely solver.cpp in solve_maze package.

- In solver.cpp subscribe to  /odom and /scan messages and publish /cmd_vel.

- In solver.cpp develop the algorithms to solve the maze and reach the target square with center located at x=0 and y=0 coordinates and each side of 2m as soon as possible. 

- Make required additions in the CMakeLists.txt file in order to be able to compile your node. Name your node as my_solver.

- Test your code in both micromouse_maze1.launch and micromouse_maze2.launch using
```
rosrun solve_maze my_solver
```

- Prepare a README.md file in your package that includes compilation steps and run steps for your code. Also include a report on maze complition times with your code as descriptive as possible.

- Create an empty repo at the following address and push your code
```
https://gitlab.com/blm6191_2023_1/members/<user>
```

Note that each time you run micromouse_maze1.launch or micromouse_maze2.launch turtlebot3 starts at a random corner of the maze.
